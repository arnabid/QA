"""
Given a list, split it into two sublists â€” one for the front half, and one for the back half.
If the number of elements is odd, the extra element should go in the front list.
So FrontBackSplit() on the list {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} should yield the two lists {2, 3, 5}
and {7, 11}.

Write a RemoveDuplicates() function which takes a list sorted in increasing order
