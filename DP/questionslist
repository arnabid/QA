Notes on DP
===========
To solve the original problem of size n, we solve smaller problems of
the same type, but of smaller sizes.

optimal substructure: optimal solutions to a problem incorporate/use
optimal solutions to related subproblems, which we may solve independently.

dynamic programming applies when the subproblems overlapâ€”that is, 
when subproblems share subsubproblems. 

A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.

A dynamic-programming approach runs in polynomial
time when the number of distinct subproblems involved is polynomial in the input
size and we can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time.
